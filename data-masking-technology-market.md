<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Masking Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static</li><li>Dynamic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Data masking technology involves altering sensitive data to protect it while maintaining its utility for various applications. The two primary market types are static and dynamic masking. Static data masking permanently modifies data in a database, creating copies that preserve privacy for testing or analytics. In contrast, dynamic data masking alters data in real-time during access, ensuring that users see only what they are authorized to view without changing the underlying data itself. Both methods enhance security and compliance.</p></p>
